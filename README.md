<h1>Election_System</h1>
<p>This project to emphasises on the importance of data security with an example.The example we have chosen is an election system where crucial data is involved such as the details of the voters including their personal information and the data of the candidates and also data pertaining to the results of an election process.
We are trying to implement various methods and algorithms to ensure the safety of the data in the stored form.Data is an important asset to any organization or an individual and thereby it is necessary to safeguard it from people wishing to use this data for malicious purposes.Thus, the security of stored data is a very crucial aspect in todayâ€™s world. As we create more and more crucial data every second it is very important that this data is stored in a safe and secure manner and that it is not accessible by unauthorized persons.

<h1>Dependencies</h1>
<li>OpenCV for C++</li>
<li>GNU Compiler for Compiling the application</li>
<h1>Overview</h1>

<p>We have designed a General Election System in which the data generated from voting is stored securely by different encryption techniques and algorithms. 
As of now, five modules have been implemented, namely Candidate, Voter, Election, Login and Admin modules. We have also worked on implementing three encryption algorithms to securely store the generated data - LSB-steganography,Modified RSA algorithm and Modified RC4.
We have used C++(14) for building up all the modules in the project. We have also used OpenCV for C++ library in the steganography implementation.</p>
