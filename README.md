## Abstract

<li>Data is an important asset to any organization or an individual and thereby it is necessary to safeguard it from people wishing to use this data for malicious purposes. Thus, the security of stored data is a very crucial aspect in todayâ€™s world. As we create more and more crucial data every second it is very important that this data is stored in a safe and secure manner and that it is not accessible by unauthorized persons and we hope this project gives us insights into safeguarding data in the modern world. </li>

<li>This project is based on the concept of file security using various encryption algorithms. Our main objective through this project is to carefully understand the various implementations of encryption techniques to different applications. To understand various techniques, we are planning to use two encryption techniques namely, modified RSA and modified RC4 algorithms. (based on improvements suggested in recent research papers). We have done a comparative analysis of other encryption algorithms with our Modified RSA, RC4 and concluded it by using the modified versions in a real world application.</li>

<li>In this project, we are implementing a General Election System in which the data generated from voting is stored securely by different encryption techniques and algorithms. In total, five modules are going to be implemented, namely Candidate, Voter, Election, Login and Admin modules. We also have to work on implementing two encryption algorithms to securely store the generated data - Modified RSA algorithm and Modified RC4 algorithm. We use C++ (14) for building up all the modules in the project. </li>
